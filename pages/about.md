# **About Me**

Hey there, I'm **Max** :metal:,<br><br>
I'm currently involved with multiple roles (website administrator, marketing executive, IT administrator) at Henry Krank & Co in Leeds. I have an educational background in IT & Computer Networks and a keen personal interest in homelabbing and self hosted services/systems. I have had my <a href="https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1049/iet-ifs.2019.0447">dissertation research published</a> in the IET Information Security academic journal, and graduated university with a high 1st Class Honours degree.
<br><br>
When I'm not working or ~~smacking~~ performing percussive maintenance on printing devices, I'll usually be tinkering with my home IT & server equipment, researching new self hosted services I can try out for myself, data hoarding, and listening to far too much music (and spreadsheeting all of it!). If you're curious to know more, I've included detailed information on the places I've worked and the projects I've been involved with on this website. If there's anything you wish to know that you can't find on here, simply drop me an email at maxingham@duck.com.
