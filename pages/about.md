# **About Me**

Hey there, I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :metal:,<br><br>
I'm currently working as a website administrator (as well as a marketing assistant, systems administrator, and frequent printer botherer) at Henry Krank & Co in Leeds. I have an educational background in IT & Computer Networks and a keen personal interest in homelabbing and self hosted services/systems. I have had my <a href="https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1049/iet-ifs.2019.0447">dissertation research published</a> in the IET Information Security academic journal, and graduated university with a high 1st Class Honours degree.
<br><br>
When I'm not working or ~~smacking~~ performing percussive maintenance on printing devices, I'll usually be tinkering with my home IT & server equipment, researching new self hosted services I can try out for myself, data hoarding, and listening to far too much music (and documenting all of it!). If you're curious to know more, read on.
