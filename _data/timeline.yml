  description: A family owned business that provides firearms, ammunition, antiques, and general sporting equipment to shooting enthusiasts and antiques collectors alike.
               While working here I have been responsible for all on-prem IT equipment as well as being in charge of all research, purchasing, documentation & aquisition of IT equipment for all departments. I have created and maintained
               various core marketing materials, and have spent more time than I'd like to count creating Excel dashboards and reports. Duties also include general site maintenance through Magento and Wordpress dashboards. <br><br>I was instrumental in the design and planning
               of the new Henry Krank website launched in 2022, as I was the main point of technical contact for our contracted developers. Tasks included creating iterative designs/mock-ups and drafting feature requests to then work with the developers to bring them to fruition, daily liaising with the developers of our internal customised EPOS system and the web developers to coordinate the implementation and testing of proposed new features and functionality and data migration, and extensively testing completed development work and then reporting/logging any errors or changes that needed to be addressed, as well as ensuring reported issues are actioned to company standards. This also included extensive hands-on post-launch bug finding and ensuring they were resolved in a timely manner as to minimise impact on customer experience.

  description: This was a brief stint for work experience while studying at university, day to day operations here were extremely sensitive and security was of paramount importance, both in terms of IT security and that of physical employee access to certain areas and secure zones of the building.
               The key tasks I performed here were account creation/manipulation in Active Directory, updating DNS records, updating systems, and troubleshooting issues raised as tickets and providing IT support to staff in various departments, from developers to quantitative analysts.
